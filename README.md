# The-game-of-Pig
The game of Pig is a simple two player dice game in which the first player to reach 100 or more points wins. The two players would be the user and the computer AI itself:

The Rules of Dice pig game are as follow:

If the player rolls a 2 to 6 then he or she can either

-> ROLL AGAIN. In this case the rolled value is added to the sum of all rolls made in this turn (i.e. the turn total) of the player and the player rolls again, or

-> HOLD. At this point the sum of all rolls made in this turn (i.e. the turn total) is added to the player’s total score and it becomes the opponent’s turn.

-> If the player rolls a 1 then the player loses his or her turn; that is the player gets no new points (i.e. the turn total becomes zero) and it becomes the opponent’s turn.

-> If a player reaches 100 or more points after holding then the player wins. Please note that rolling is performed using random number generator; generating one of the points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 for each roll.

Notes: For the computer turns, it will keep rolling until it has accumulated 20 or more points after which it will hold anf give turn to human player.

Also human player goes first automatically.
